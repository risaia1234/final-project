<p>Chromosomal Disorders are conditions caused by defects in ones chromosomes.  My topic explores what types of chromosomal disorders there are and how they form at a cellular level. For that, we need some background knowledge.</p>
<p>Lets start at the beginning. Gametes are haploid cells that are used for sexual reproduction. One gamete from the male and one from the female to create a diploid. For males, its called sperm and for females, its called an egg. The process in which Gametes are made is called Meiosis. Most organisms have 2 sets of chromosomes in there <strong>somatic</strong> cells but gametes have one set.</p>

Mitosis is the process in which cells split and result in somatic cells. Those cells are <strong>diploids</strong>. Meiosis is the process of splitting diploids into <strong>haploids</strong>. Instead of the cell having two sets of chromosomes like in mitosis, they have one set of chromosomes that are used in sexual reproduction.</p>
<p>Meiosis comes in two parts. Meiosis 1 and Meiosis 2.</p>
<ol>
<li>Meiosis 1 is where a <strong>diploid germ</strong> cell splits into two diploid daughter cells.
<ul>
<li>Interphase: Chromosomes need to duplicate creating <strong>sister chromatids</strong>.</li>
<li>Prophase I: Homologous chromosomes pair together forming <strong>tetrads</strong>. This formation of tetrads is called <strong>Synapsis</strong>. Then, a process called <strong>crossing over</strong> occurs. Segments of DNA are exchanged between homologous chromosomes creating more genetic variation.</li>
<li>Metaphase I: <strong>Microtubules</strong> move the tetrads to the <strong>metaphase plate</strong> (in the middle of the two <strong>centrioles</strong>).</li>
<li>Anaphase I: Tthe tetrads split apart but keep the sister chromatids together.</li>
<li>Telophase I: The cell splits into 2 diploid daughter cells.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meiosis 2 is where the daughter cells from Meiosis 1 get there sister chromatids separated as well forming four haploid cells.
<ul>
<li>Metaphase II: The sister chromatids meet at the metaphase plate.</li>
<li>Anaphase II: The sister chromatids split up and move towards the poles of the cell.</li>
<li>Telophase II: The cell divides and as a result, 4 haploid cells form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Chromosomal Disorders stem from many different anomalys but  <strong>translocation</strong>, <strong>nondisjunction</strong>, and <strong>inversion</strong> are the most common.</p>
<p>Nondisjunction is when the chromosomes don’t properly separate. It can happen in Meiosis 1 or Meiosis 2.</p>

<p>Translocation is when a segment of a chromosome breaks off and reattaches itself either on another chromosome or on the chromosome it broke off of. There are 2 types of translocation. Reciprocal translocation and non-reciprocal translocation.</p>

Inversion is when a part of a chromosome detaches, flips around 180° and reattaches. If a chromosome includes the detachment of the <strong>centromere</strong>, then it’s called <strong>pericentric</strong> and if it doesn’t include it, then it’s <strong>paracentric</strong>.</p>
